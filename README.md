emokid
======

For those times when you're having trouble expressing how you feel about your broken code.

Installation
------------

You can install emokid directly from GitHub:

``` r
devtools::install_github("itsrainingdata/emokid")
```

Overview
--------

For when your code is broken:

``` r
# 1+"a"
iamsad()
#> breathe in deep, let it out slow. did you hear it's all my fault again?
```

For the true emo kids out there, there is the convenient `iamlesssad` method for when you fix your code:

``` r
1+1
iamlesssad()
#> more nights of hugging my pillow, oh replaying memories.
```

**Note:** This is just a wrapper to the aforementioned `iamsad` method.
